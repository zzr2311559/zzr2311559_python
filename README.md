## Changing Case in a String with Methods
Here is the code:

      name = "ada lovelace"
      print(name.title())

**name**      is the variable refers to the lowercase string "ada lovelace"

**title()**   is a method 

**.**         is a sign to tell python to make the **title()** method act on the variable **name**



method:A method is an action that Python can preform on a piece of data. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because
methods often need additional information to do their work. That information is provided inside the parentheses.  The title() function doesnâ€™t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty. 

*Tips* you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters like this:

      name = 'Ada Lovelace'
      print(name.upper())
      print(name.lower())
